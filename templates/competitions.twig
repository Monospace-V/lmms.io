			\* *This year the judging process has changed, to ensure fairer handling of entries. The change to one submission only is to allow each and every entry to be fully scored by the panel of judges. This was previously handled by a preliminary screening round to help cut down the large amount of entries received. By lowering the amount of up-front entries allowed, the judges will have the time to fully score each track entered.*

			Extras:

			By marking your song with the tag "Want Feedback" you can get feedback from the judges. Comments from different judges will be combined into one
			text so you won't know from who or how many the feedback is. Note that you aren't guaranteed any feedback, it depends on how much time the judges have.
			Also note that the judges are just regular LMMS artists and no matter what feedback you get the judges' decision for album songs is final.
